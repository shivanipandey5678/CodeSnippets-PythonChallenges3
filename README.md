### Python Code Samples Repository

This GitHub repository contains a collection of Python code snippets addressing various programming challenges and tasks. Each code snippet corresponds to a specific problem or scenario, demonstrating different aspects of Python programming.

1. **Managing Finances (File: `1_financial_management.py`):**
   - Takes user input for an array of expenses, compares it with a given salary, and categorizes the financial status as "Debt," "Save," or "Neutral."

2. **Vowel and Consonant Count (File: `2_vowel_consonant_count.py`):**
   - Reads a matrix of characters, counts the occurrences of vowels and consonants, and calculates a weighted sum based on the count.

3. **String Compression (File: `3_string_compression.py`):**
   - Implements a simple string compression algorithm to represent consecutive repeated characters with the character and its count.

4. **Equal Sum Subarrays (File: `4_equal_sum_subarrays.py`):**
   - Determines if it's possible to divide an array into three contiguous subarrays with equal sums.

5. **Matrix Zigzag Printing (File: `5_matrix_zigzag.py`):**
   - Prints a matrix in a zigzag pattern, alternating the direction of traversal for odd and even rows.

6. **Column-wise Even Sum (File: `6_columnwise_even_sum.py`):**
   - Calculates the sum of even numbers in each column of a matrix.

7. **GitHub Description Generator (File: `7_github_description.py`):**
   - Not an actual code but a placeholder for generating a GitHub repository description.
